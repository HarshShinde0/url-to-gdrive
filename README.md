## Requirements

- Python 3.x

```

## Usage

### 1. Download the file

```

### 2. Upload to Google Drive

The script will ask for the downloaded filename and upload it to your Google Drive.

## Google Drive Authentication

The script uses Google OAuth credentials to authenticate.  
- On Google Colab, authentication happens automatically via `google.colab.auth`.  
- Locally, you need to set up OAuth credentials or use a service account.
